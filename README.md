## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an image of User
- See a email address of user
- Can generate a new user user by clicking the 'Get Random User' button
- The ring colour around the profile picture and the colour of the 'Get Random User' button will change to either blue or pink, according to user's gender

### What I learned

- How to create Vue components
- How to route pages together in Vue
- How to connect to a server that holds data


### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add an edit page that will allow the user to edit the tasks. This could be useful when, for example, you want to change a date or time on a task.
